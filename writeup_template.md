### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

The joint diagram describing the KR210 manipulator is:

![alt text][image4]


Links | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i-1) | theta(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0->1 | 0 | 0 | 0.75 | q1
1->2 | - pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | -pi/2 + q2
2->3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | q3
3->4 |  - pi/2	 | -0.054	 | 1.5 | q4
4->5 | pi/2	 | 0 | 0 | q5
5->6 | -pi/2	 | 0 | 0 | q6
6->EE | 0 | 0 | 0.303 | 0

The constants in the table were derived from values in the the manufacturere supplied kr210.urdf.xacro file as follows:

(The values in the urdf file are relative to previous joint)

The alpha values describe the orientation of a joint's Z axis relative to the previous joint's Z axis and are either 0, pi/2, or -pi/2 radions.  (0,90,-90 degrees).  They are derived from the unit vectors described in the axis tag.

The axis choices are defined by the DH convention choices and don't always match the manufacturers choice.

The 'd' values are the displacement of the joints z axiz as measured along the x azis

```
a1:  .35  x value of Joint 2 position (line 330)
a2: 1.25  z value of Joint 3 position (line 337)
a3: -.54  z value of Joint 4 position (line 344)
```

The 'd' values are the displacement of the joints x axiz as measured along the z azis

```
d1:  .75  z value of Joint 1 position (line 323) + z value of Joint 2 position (line 330)
d4: 1.50  x value of Joint 4 position (line 344) + x value of Joint 5 position (line 351)
d7: .303  x value of Gripper Joint position (line 288) + x value of Joint 6 position (line 358)
```

A dictionary of these constants and variables can be constructed as follows:

```
DH_Table = {
        alpha0:       0, a0:      0, d1: 0.75, q1:          q1,
        alpha1: -pi / 2, a1:   0.35, d2:    0, q2: q2 - pi / 2,
        alpha2:       0, a2:   1.25, d3:    0, q3:          q3,
        alpha3: -pi / 2, a3: -0.054, d4: 1.50, q4:          q4,
        alpha4:  pi / 2, a4:      0, d5:    0, q5:          q5,
        alpha5: -pi / 2, a5:      0, d6:    0, q6:          q6,
        alpha6:       0, a6:      0, d7:0.303, q7:           0 }
```

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

The individual transformation matrices about each joint can be constructed by first defining a function that creates the matrix and substitues the values from the DH table defined above.  Then, each joint to joint table can be defined by calling this function with the corresponding symbols and supplying the DH table.

```
    def make_T(twist_angle, link_length, link_offset, joint_angle, subvals):
        m = Matrix([[cos(joint_angle), -sin(joint_angle), 0, link_length],
                    [sin(joint_angle) * cos(twist_angle), cos(joint_angle) * cos(twist_angle), -sin(twist_angle),
                     -sin(twist_angle) * link_offset],
                    [sin(joint_angle) * sin(twist_angle), cos(joint_angle) * sin(twist_angle), cos(twist_angle),
                     cos(twist_angle) * link_offset],
                    [0, 0, 0, 1]])
        return m.subs(subvals)

    # Create individual transformation matrices

    T0_1 = make_T(alpha0,a0,d1,q1,DH_Table)
    T1_2 = make_T(alpha1,a1,d2,q2,DH_Table)
    T2_3 = make_T(alpha2,a2,d3,q3,DH_Table)
    T3_4 = make_T(alpha3,a3,d4,q4,DH_Table)
    T4_5 = make_T(alpha4,a4,d5,q5,DH_Table)
    T5_6 = make_T(alpha5,a5,d6,q6,DH_Table)
    T6_G = make_T(alpha6,a6,d7,q7,DH_Table)
```

Here is the generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose. R is roll, P is pitch, Y is yaw.  px,py,pz is the gripper position.

```

[cos(p)*cos(Y), sin(p)*sin(r)*cos(Y) - sin(y)*cos(R), sin(P)*cos(R)*cos(Y) + sin(R)*sin(Y), px]
[sin(y)*cos(P), sin(p)*sin(r)*sin(Y) + cos(r)*cos(Y), sin(P)*sin(Y)*cos(R) - sin(R)*cos(Y), py]
[      -sin(P),                        sin(r)*cos(P),                        cos(P)*cos(R), pz]
             0,                                    0,                                    0,  1]

```




#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

And here's where you can draw out and show your math for the derivation of your theta angles.

The last three joints (4,5,6) form a wrist such that the center of joint 5 is the wrist center.  No matter what adjustments you make to joint 4,5, or 6 the position in world coordinates of the wrist center will not change.  The wrist center position is dependant only on joints 1,2,3.  So we can seperate the inverse kinematics problem, one to find the joint angles 1,2,3 from the wrist position, and the second to find the joint angles 4,5,6 from the orientation of the gripper.  The orientation is it's roll, pitch and yaw.

#### Inverse Position Kinematics

Since Joint 2 and Joint 3 have parallel z axis, their theta angles can be derived from the same triangle as projected on the x-y plane as shown below:

![alt text][image5]

Side A is a the constant distance between joint 3 and the wrist center.  It is is measured with RViz and set accordingly.
Side C is the constant distance between joint 2 and 3.
Side B is the calculated distance between joint 2 and the wrist center.  Since the wc is in world coordinates, the postion of joint 2 needs to be subtracted from it.

```
        side_a = 1.501
        side_b = sqrt(pow((sqrt(WC[0] * WC[0] + WC[1] * WC[1]) - 0.35), 2) + pow((WC[2] - .75), 2))
        side_c = 1.25
```

The law of cosines states that if you know the lengths of each of the sides of a triangle, you can calculate each of the interior angles.  Thus:

```
        angle_a = acos((side_b * side_b + side_c * side_c - side_a * side_a) / (2 * side_b * side_c))
        angle_b = acos((side_a * side_a + side_c * side_c - side_b * side_b) / (2 * side_a * side_c))
        angle_c = acos((side_a * side_a + side_b * side_b - side_c * side_c) / (2 * side_a * side_b))
```
Theta2 is the remaining angle after you subtract angle_a plus the angle formed by side B and the x axis from 90 degrees.
Link 4 sags by a small fixed amount (.036 rads) so theta3 is the remainder of angle_b and the sag angle subtraced from 90 degrees.

```
        theta2 = pi / 2 - angle_a - atan2(WC[2] - .75, sqrt(WC[0] * WC[0] + WC[1] * WC[1]) - 0.35)
        theta3 = pi / 2 - (angle_b + .036)  # .036 accounts for sag in link4 of -.054m
```

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
